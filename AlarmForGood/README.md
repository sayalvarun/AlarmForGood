 Alarm-For-Good

This is a mobile, currently android application that is designed to encourage two things, Productivity and Charity.

The application will do the following:

Specifications:
-Allow the user to create one or more alarms for specified times.
-Specify the type of tone the user will hear.
-Give the alarm a name.
-Assign it to repeat weekly, monthly, daily, etc.
-Alert the user by ringing the tone at the specified time.
-Allow the user to snooze the alarm.
-Snoozing the alarm will create a transaction from the user's PayPal account to a charity of their choice valued at 1/10 of 1 cent.
-The user must be allowed to increase this amount, 1/10 of one penny is the minimum amount.
-The user must be able to log in to their PayPal account through the app, and authorize the app to make payments.
-As a failsafe, the user should be asked to input a maximum amount of charity donation to be issued as the app could then create a transaction immediately after the alarm is turned off. This would ensure that bugs would not result in real loss of large amounts of money.
